Trivial Python class to be used with Sigfox backend http API.

Author: Marcel Hecko maco@blava.net

Run example like this (use your own API username and password):

SIGFOX_API_LOGIN='5787d7bf3cxxx9106c93c795' SIGFOX_API_PASSWORD='b8faf16exxx11dd1bb1789cb25028e3b' ./example.py

Username and password is not the same as the credential you use to access Sigfox backend!
To get the API access credentials, log into Sigfox backend, then go to Groups -> select group -> API ACCESS.
Then click on 'new' and create new access entry.
